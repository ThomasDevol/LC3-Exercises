    "## LC3 ISA\n",
    "The ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) for a machine is comprised of the following components:\n",
    "1. The Set of Instructions supported\n",
    "2. The Number of Registers both General-purpose and speical\n",
    "3. The memory-layout: _address space_ and _addressability_ of the machine\n",
    "4. The addressing modes supported\n",
    "5. The data-types supported\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISA is a _specification_ that is akin to a standards document that describes in detail the __what__ a machine __does__. The __how__ it does it, is called the implementation. For example, the ARM ISA describes what instructions an ARM-based machine understands, how to format them correctly and, what happens when you run them. The how is left to the manufacturer. The same ARM ISA is implemented in an iPhone from Apple, and an Android phone from (say) Samsung. One may be faster than the other but they both understand the same set of instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LC3 ISA then, answers these five components thusly:\n",
    "1. LC3 instruction set has 15 instructions: \n",
    "   1. Arithmetic-Logic: `NOT`,`AND`,`ADD`\n",
    "   2. Data-Movement: Loads - `LD`, `LDR`, `LDI`; Stores - `ST`, `STR`, `STI`; `LEA`\n",
    "   3. Control: `BR`, `JMP`, `JSR`, `TRAP`, `RTI`\n",
    "  ![LC3 ISA](LC3-ISA.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. LC3 has 8 general-purpose registers called $\\texttt{R_0},\\texttt{R_1},\\texttt{R_2},\\texttt{R_3},\\texttt{R_4},\\texttt{R_5},\\texttt{R_6},\\texttt{R_7}$ and, two special registers, PC (holds the location/address of the _next_ instruction), IR (holds the instruction currently executing)  and PSR (holds the status of the processor, specifically the `N`,`Z`, and `P` bits, collectively referred to as the Condition Code (`CC`) bits.\n",
    "3. LC3's memory is made of $2^{16}$ locations (_address space_) of $16$ bits (_addressability_) each. You can think of memory as a table with $2^{16}$ rows and $16$ columns.\n",
    "4. LC3 supports _five_ addressing modes. This tells us _where_ an operaand to an operation can be found. \n",
    "   1. Register: In a register\n",
    "   2. Immediate: In the instruction itself as a signed integer\n",
    "   3. PC+Offset: At a position relative to the PC\n",
    "   4. Base+Offset: At a position relative to a Base-register\n",
    "   5. Indirect: At an address to be found at a position relative to the PC\n",

    "alt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n",
    "5. LC3 supports two types of data:\n",
    "   1. Characters (ASCII)\n",
    "   2. Signed Integers (in 2's complement)\n",

    "## Assembler\n",
    "Programmers write code in assembly language which uses mnemonics (symbols) to represent instructions. Each instruction is made up of an _operation_ and one or more _operand(s)_. The computer only understands instructions expressed in _binary_. So, an __assembler__ converts instructions written in assembly to binary that the machine understands. The binary version of the instruction is also referred to as _machine code_. The LC3 assembler allows the programmer to express their intent (the program) using _instructions_ supported by the ISA and, _pseudo-ops_, that are commands to the assembler. Pseudo-ops are easily recognized by the fact that they have a period (`.`) at their beginning. For instance, the pseudo-op, `.ORIG x3000` tells the assembler that the code that follows must be loaded to the location `x3000`."

    "## Instruction Execution\n",
    "The execution of an individual instruction in LC3 happens in 6 stages:\n",
    "1. **Instruction Fetch**: The instruction is fetched from Memory to CPU (IR register); The PC is updated\n",
    "2. **Decode**: The most significant 4 bits IR[15-12] are decoded to figure out what theis instruction is.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Address**: __If__ there is an address to be computed, for example, in LD/ST, LDR/STR, LEA, LDI/STI and, BR, JSR, TRAP, JMP __Then__ the address computation is done here. \n",
    "4. **Fetch Operands**: __If__ there is an operand tthat needs to be brought in from __Memory__ __then__ this is the stage in which this happens. Only LD, LDR, LDI have an an operand fetch. Arithmetic operations get their operands from registers or the IR (in case of immediate operand), so there is no need to go to memory.\n",
    "5. **Execute**: Any arithmetic/logic work and, the decision to branch or not to branch happen in this stage. \n",
    "6. **Store Result**: The writing of the result to the destination register happens in this stage.\n",
    "\n",

    "The next two instrcutions acheive the same thing as the previous `LD` instruction. The `LEA` instruction gets the address of Input into register `R3` (`x3013`). The `LDR` instruction then uses the address in R3 as the __base__ (instead of the PC) and adds an __offset__ (of 0) to that address to fetch the contents of memory location `x3013`, putting that (`xABCD`) intor `R4`. \n",

Also, the `LDR` is able to access not just the contents of the location whose address is in `R3` but any location that can be specified by an offset relative to `R3`. As you will see in a later instruction, `STR R0,R3,1`, we are able to write a value to the `Output` by using `R3` as the __base__ and using an __offset__ of 1.\n",

    "## Changing the flow\n",
    "So far in our example, the PC got incremented by one on each instruction execution. This means we are executing the code _sequentially_ stepping one instruction after an other. All programming languages support the ability to _change_ the flow, i.e., go _forward_ a block ($\\geq 1$) instructions or go _back_ to a point before the current instruction based on a _condition_. This is called a __conditional__ statement. After executing a condition statement, the `PC` (recall it holds the address of the next instruction to execute) can either, just `PC+1` or `PC+<Offset_to_the_point_forward_or_backward_to_go>`, depending on whether the condition is `false` or `true`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The condition itself is expressed in the form of a check of the three condition code(`CC`) bits `N`, `Z` and `P`, which indicate whether the \"__most recent__\" operation resulted in a `negative` value, a `zero` value or, a `positive` value respectively. As, not all instructions modify these bits, the check is really based on the \"__most recent condition code modifying__\" instruction. In the LC3 instruction list above, all instructions that modify the CC bits are indicated with a `+` on them. Here is that list: `ADD`,`AND`, `NOT`,`LD`, `LDR`, `LDI` and `LEA`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here, we want to see __if__ the `Input` (which is currently in both registers `R1` and `R4`) is equal or not equal to `42`. So, we take the difference between `R1` and `-42`(which is in `R2`) and test whether the result is a __zero__. That is, if the `Z` bit is set. If it is indeed set then we know `Input` is `42` (which by the way is the ASCII character `*`: star). So, we branch to a location labeled `IsStar`, i.e., set `PC` to the address of `IsStar`. Note, that if the condition check fails then `PC` simply stays the course (i.e., `PC+1`). In this example, the Input is `42`, so the result of the ADD is a zero and the branch will be taken, with the new value of `PC` being `x300E`. "

We will now use a service provided by the LC3 operating system that does exactly that - Displays an output (in this case a character) on the console.

    "For example, to invoke a service that outputs a single character to the console the Trap Vector we use is `x21`. The trap service expects that the character you want displayed will be put in register `R0`. So, for example, assuming the register `R0` has the hex value `x2A` (decimal 42, which is the ASCII code for the character `*`) then, the service will display a `*` on the console. We see from the table above that there are assembly shortcuts (`OUT` for `TRAP x21`) for each TRAP service, so one does not have to memorize the Trap Vector values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, the value `42` is in register `R1` and not in `R0`. So we first copy R1 to R0 and then invoke the TRAP service. Here, I dont want to step through the service routine so I set a break-point at the instruction after `TRAP x21` at address `x3010` and continue the execution:"
